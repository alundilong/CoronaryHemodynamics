4 - ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION NOTES
-----------------------------------------

 * It's advisable that blueCFD-Core package should be installed in a permissive folder, e.g "C:\blueCFD-Core", but this is not obligatory.

 * If permissions are not enough for installation, the installer provides the option to enforce the correct folder access permissions.

 * If the installation folder is meant to be kept as read-only, blueCFD-Core will create working folders in the current user's own disk-space (for example, at 'C:\Users').

 * If you are uncertain how to proceed with the installation, please visit the blueCFD-Core User Guides webpage: http://bluecfd.github.io/Core/UserGuide/
